  <h1>PIZZA ORDER SYSTEM</h1>
 </div>
 
 I made a prototype for a pizza restaurant ordering system. I used **Tkinter** and **OOP** approach (instead of functionality) to make this project. 
 Without further ado, let's take a look at the project. 
 
 First you get to the home page, where you can browse the menus or order. We have 3 different menus in our system.
 
 - Pizza
 - Toppings
 - Sauce

There are several types of Italian Pizza on the menu such as Pizza Napoletana, Margherita. If you would like to order one of them, unfortunately 
we are **unable** to add any **sauces or toppings**. Because I believe that this type of pizza should be eaten as it is. 
But you can add any kind of sauce or toppings to the rest.

The order summary will be stored in a **csv** file after the order is complete. The demo is below.

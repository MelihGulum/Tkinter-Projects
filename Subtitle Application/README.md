  <h1>SUBTITLE APPLICATION</h1>
 </div>
 
 Sometimes you may not be able to find the subtitle options for the language you want. Unfortunately neither do I. 
 So I made my own subtitle app with Tkinter. Let's take look. 
 
First you have to load the str file. You will then see the following screen.

After starting the subtitle, your screen will change for better watching. All these changes can be seen below the picture.

- Window size is reduced
- Window made **transparent** and **alpha** is changed.
- Button background colors changed to white

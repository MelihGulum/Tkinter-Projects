  <h1>SUBTITLE APPLICATION</h1>
 </div>
 
 Sometimes you may not be able to find the subtitle options for the language you want. Unfortunately neither do I. 
 So I made my own subtitle app with Tkinter. Let's take look. 
 
<h2>How to Run</h2>

 * First, you need to upload the Subtitle File (.srt) using the "Upload" button.
 * Then, you can use the media control buttons to start, stop, fast forward, rewind and reset the timer.
 * You can also use the "word" button if you want to see the (unique) words in the subtitle file as a txt.
   - The txt file will be located in the same folder as "Subtitle_App.py" as with the name "words.txt".

After starting the subtitle, your screen will change for better watching. All these changes can be seen below the picture.

- Window size is reduced
- Window made **transparent** and **alpha** is changed.
- Button background colors changed to white

<h2>What's new in Version 2?</h2>

* A "load" button has been added to increase usability and make it more user-friendly.
* A "word" button has been added for those who want to expand their vocabulary while watching the series.

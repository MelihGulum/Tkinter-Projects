  <h1>TEAM BANK ATM</h1>
 </div>
 
 This project is made with **Python (Tkinter)** and **Sqlite**. There are also two types of users in the project. There are also two types of users in the project. The first is "Client" and the other is "Teller". 
 
 I know there are no bank employees at the ATM. But this project is an exception. Because we needed to add clients somehow. Below you can find brief information about the two users.
 
 ## CLIENT
 
 Default User Account ID is **1804** and the Password is **1000**
 
 Client can do:
- Make a **withdrawal** from his/her own account.
  * Money can be withdrawn from the account in multiples of 50 or the user can enter a value.
  * In addition, when withdrawing money, the balance is prevented from falling into negative.
- Check his/her **balance**.
- **Deposit** money into his/her account.
  * The user cannot deposit negative amounts or more than 10,000 values.
